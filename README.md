## Technical Experience on Your Resume

The Technical Projects section is one of the most important parts of your resume (in fact this section will take up about ⅔ of your resume!). Interviewers will read this section carefully to gauge your skill set and determine how you'll be able to contribute to the team. In any hiring situation, interviewers want to know that you actually **can** do the job.

It's also the place where you get to show off the projects you've built and display your technical chops.

- Your Technical skills can be listed as Experience or Exposure
- Highlight your additional training (certifications planned to obtain or completed)
- Professional Affiliation is a Plus! 


## What Technical People Care About

In the land of technology, objectivity trumps subjectivity and specificity reigns supreme. That is to say, technical folk value specific contributions to a project and how those contributions played their part in the overall system. When you describe your work, you always want to pinpoint what technologies you used and why. 

You should illustrate your strengths, especially when they relate to different technologies, solutions concepts and regulatory standards. As a rule though, do not list anything that you cannot back up with a level of work experience or that you would not be able to have an informed discussion on with someone who has expertise in the area. 

Be careful about claiming to be an "expert" on any  topic--it may cause some doubts about your level of proficiency. Also, when you claim to be an expert, interviewers will often choose to challenge you during an interview to validate your claim.

Highlighting technology details applies to both  both solo labs/projects and group labs/projects.  If you collaborated with others, make sure you have a clear understanding of all components of the project, including the features your partners built, what technologies they chose, and why. You’ll need to know this when it comes time to interview.

### **Descriptive Bullets for Projects**

Take a few minutes and reflect on the projects you completed. Ask yourself the questions posed earlier:

- Why did you build what you built?
- What problem did it solve?
- What technologies did you use?

Now, in your first resume draft, adapt this information to the Technical Projects section for each of the projects you built or were involved in building. You'll review this section with your coach. It can also be helpful to have a technical peer, mentor, or friend review the technical section of your resume to ensure your bullet points are articulated in the best way possible.

Each bullet point follows a general pattern, with the following components:

**Action Verb + Task + Result**

**Action Verb** = Past/Present Tense 
**Task** =  What did you do? What did you build? Include the technologies you used to build.
**Result** = Go beyond telling what you did and describe how and why you did it? 
  - What did you accomplish?  
  - What was the result/impact of your project/work? 
  - What was the purpose?

NOTE: The specific purpose component is a critical component of each bullet, especially given that each of your projects was created to serve a unique purpose and audience/end user. In turn, your bullets should look unique from each other. Even if you used similar technologies or frameworks across different projects, each project has its own features and functionalities. Take the opportunity to use each bullet to both own and educate the reader on the unique aspects of each project that they should know about, at a glance. Avoid having several bullets across various projects with vague and/or the exact same wording. Instead, 'paint a picture' of exactly what specific functionality a technology enables in a project, unique to that project.

Students have told us that optimizing their project bullets this way helps them feel more confident in talking about what they learned and WHY they utilized certain technologies/methods...which will help you build your technical communication skills in general!

**Here is an example of a project that utilizes the concepts outlined above:**

- Currently conducting individual projects using Python to perform web scraping on threat intel feeds, correlating the feed data to assign risk levels, and outputting a text and/or STIX file for use.
- Gained understanding of both LogRhythm and Splunk SIEM consoles by initiating logging on the systems and integrating the logs with each console. Deployed both consoles on different VMs.
- Installed Windows Servers, Linux Servers, and virtual machines running Kali-Linux and Ubuntu. 
- Utilized Nmap and Wireshark to perform network discovery, packet capture and traffic analysis.
- Via SecureSet Capstone project, will gain hands-on experience handling security incidents, including review of raw log files, data correlation, and analysis. Will actively hunt for and dissect previously unidentified threats. Will differentiate between potential intrusion attempts and false alarms

Notice that above we leave the subjective language at the door. Instead, there are no adorning adjectives or qualifiers here. We don’t want opinions; just the facts on how you built each project. That's what counts.
